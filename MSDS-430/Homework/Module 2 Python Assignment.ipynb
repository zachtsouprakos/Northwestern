    "<font color=green> This week we are starting to learn how to write short programs in Python beyond \"Hello World!\" We're learning about different data types such as integers, floats, strings, and Boolean types. Each of these data types serves different purposes. In this assignment, we start working with these data types and get our feet wet with conditional statements. Conditionals are quite useful in programming and we will work with them from here on out. We will get some good practice with conditional statements in this assignment.  </font>"
